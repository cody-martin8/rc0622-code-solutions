- User can sign up
  - Clicking "Register now" changes the href to '#sign-up'
  - When user is entering a username and password, handleChange is actively updating state with those values
  - When "Register" is clicked, handleSubmit is called
    - 'sign-up' is passed to 'action'
    - The username and password are stringified for the fetch POST request
      - fetch is called with 'sign-up' being passed into the request path
      - the user information is posted to the database
      - Since action = 'sign-up', hash is changed to 'sign-in' to redirect the user to the log-in page after signing up.

- User can sign in
  - User inputs username and password
  - When "Log In" is clicked, handleSubmit is called
    - 'sign-in' is passed to 'action'
    - The username and password are stringified for the fetch POST request
      - fetch is called with 'sign-in' being passed into the request path
      - if a user and token are returned in the result, onSignIn(handleSignIn) is called
        - token is placed in local storage and user state of App is changed to reflect userId
      - render => renderPage => JSX Auth => JSX Redirect is called with to=''
        - hash changed to '#', and window location changed to reflect that
          - route is parsed from window.location.hash
          - render => renderPage => JSX Home
            - this.context.user has value of the userId, bypassing JSX Redirect
            - renders the app's main page to see the gif'screen

- User can stay signed in
  - since 'path' = '' when renderPage is called, JSX Home is called
    - this.context.user has value of the userId, bypassing JSX Redirect
    - renders the app's main page to see the gif screen
  - this works on refresh too, as the token is saved in localStorage
    - as long as the token has a valid value, user is not changed to null
      - this prevents JSX Home from triggering JSX Redirect to "sign-in"

- User can sign out
  - User clicks Sign out button in navbar
    - handleSignOut is called
      - the token is removed from localStorage and user state is set to null
      - on render, JSX Home is called
        - as user is a falsey value, JSX Redirect is called with to="sign-in"
          - hash is changed to 'sign-in'
          - on render, renderPage directs to JSX Auth
            - as route.path = 'sign-in', the sign-in page is rendered
